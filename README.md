# Simple Bank Terminal Thing

Hello, this is a simple terminal program, that asks the user to login, and if theyd like to withdraw or deposit money. As of the wallet update the user can now add and subtract moeny from their bank balance into their wallet, naturally that means the user can also make an error if they try to deposit more then they have or withdrawal more than they have.


# Future Plans?

Ultiamtely I want to transfer the program from the terminal to a GUI, using something like GTK4.0. I did originally try doing it but found its a lot more complex than Pythons Tkinter.. so as of now Im just writing it for the terminal and may eventually rewrite it for a GUI.

# About Login

User: 4068
PIN: 8163

Yeah im completely aware of the fact I have a user id and pin hard coded. Its really not supposed to be anything special/secure aside from an extra conditional because I was bored, also theres only one user.. so maybe later Ill actually ad a fake database of various users/pins and work off that.

# Simple Bank Terminal Thing

Hello, this is a simple terminal program, that asks the user to login, and if theyd like to withdraw or deposit money. Additional options may be added as I add stuff


# Future Plans?

Ultiamtely I want to transfer the program from the terminal to a GUI, using something like GTK4.0. I did originally try doing it but found its a lot more complex than Pythons Tkinter.. so as of now Im just writing it for the terminal and may eventually rewrite it for a GUI.

# Log in Not Secure?

Yeah im completely aware of the fact I have a user id and pin hard coded. Its really not supposed to be anything special aside from an extra conditional because I was bored, also theres only one user.. so maybe later Ill actually ad a fake database of various users/pins and work off that.
